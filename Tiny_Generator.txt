Project: Tiny – AI-Powered Prompt Generator
Purpose: Create a browser-based AI app that generates spontaneous, positive prompts for users to engage with. Designed to combat boredom, encourage social interaction or self-reflection, and provide a gamified, fun experience.
Target Users: Young adults (18–35) looking for a quick, meaningful alternative to scrolling on social media.
Core Features: 1. AI Prompt Generation - Personalized prompts based on: - Current location, time, and mood - Alone vs. around other people - Types of prompts: - Solo: self-reflection, writing, breathwork, light fitness - Social: icebreaker questions, compliments, small-talk activities
2.	Gamification & Interaction
o	Users swipe to accept/reject 3 suggested prompts
o	Accepting a prompt starts a 5-minute timer
o	Completion triggers proof submission: text, photo, or audio
3.	Diary / Log
o	Save completed prompts with timestamp
o	Browse by month/year
o	Preview shows time and summary
4.	Contextual Customization
o	Prompts account for social comfort zones
o	Realistic and actionable, including optional follow-ups
Technical Requirements: - OpenAI API – generate personalized prompts - Image/Media Handling – upload/view proof of completion - Frontend – responsive UI for web browsers - UX Features – swipe gestures, timers, diary preview
Project Goals: - Initial Lo-Fi prototype for UX testing - Iterative improvements based on feedback - Final goal: fully functional browser-based application with polished UI/UX
